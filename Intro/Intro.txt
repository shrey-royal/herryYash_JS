Overview:

JavaScript is a Scripting language that is used to make web pages interactive. It is a high-level, interpreted, and dynamic programming language. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

Some Javascript's Interpreters are:

1. Chrome V8
2. Mozilla SpiderMonkey
3. Microsoft Chakra
4. Apple JavaScriptCore
5. Brave Muon
6. Opera Carakan

JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning only one task can be executed at a time. The browser provides a runtime environment for JavaScript. JavaScript can call itself asynchronously, meaning that other tasks can continue while the JavaScript is executing.
