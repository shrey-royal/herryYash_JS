Sure, here are 20 basic JavaScript problem statements covering the topics of Introduction, Variables and Datatypes, Operators, Control Flow, Functions, and Arrays:

**Introduction:**

1. Create a JavaScript program that displays "Hello, World!" in the console.
2. Write a program that prompts the user for their name and then displays a greeting message with their name.
3. Calculate the sum of two numbers entered by the user and display the result.
4. Create a program that checks if a given number is even or odd and displays a message accordingly.
5. Write a JavaScript program that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

**Variables and Datatypes:**

6. Declare a variable and store your age in it. Display the age in the console.
7. Create a variable to store your name and another variable to store your favorite color. Display a message that includes both in the console.
8. Calculate the area of a rectangle with given length and width, storing the result in a variable.
9. Declare a variable with a boolean value and display it in the console.
10. Create a program that calculates the average of three test scores using variables and displays the result.

**Operators:**

11. Write a program that calculates the area of a circle using the radius entered by the user.
12. Create a program that checks if a given number is divisible by 3 and 5 and displays a message accordingly.
13. Calculate the square of a number and then take the square root of the result.
14. Use the comparison operators to compare two numbers and display whether they are equal or not.
15. Write a program that converts minutes to hours and minutes, displaying both values.

**Control Flow:**
